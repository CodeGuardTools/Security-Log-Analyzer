While this free tool is useful, our **Premium Version** is a professional-grade threat intelligence tool designed for high-security environments like crypto exchanges and financial applications.

### Premium Features Include:
-   **Threat Scoring System:** Instead of just flagging threats, it assigns a "Threat Score" to each IP based on their actions.
-   **Behavioral Analysis:** Detects suspicious patterns like endpoint scanning (`/admin`) and the use of hacking tools (`sqlmap`).
-   **Stateful Correlation Engine (Most Powerful Feature):** Understands the *context* of an attack. It can identify attackers who strike during periods of network instability (e.g., when your connection to a crypto node is down).
-   **Automated JSON & TXT Reporting:** Generates clean, professional reports for analysis and integration.
-   **No Dependencies:** Runs on any system with Python 3, no extra libraries needed.

### Why You Need the Premium Version
Modern attackers are smart. They don't just use one technique. Our premium tool analyzes the *entire picture* to find complex threats that other systems miss.
